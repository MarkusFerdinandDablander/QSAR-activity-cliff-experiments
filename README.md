# Systematically Exploring QSAR Models for Activity-Cliff Prediction

Code to reproduce the experiments in the paper Systematically Exploring QSAR Models for Activity-Cliff Prediction. This repository also contains clean molecule- and MMP data for all three analyses data sets (dopamine receptor D2, factor Xa, SARS-CoV-2 main protease) and the numerical results of the experiments conducted in the paper for further visualisation and investigation.
